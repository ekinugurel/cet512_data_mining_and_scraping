# CET 512 - Data Mining, Scraping, and General Discussion on Datasets You Can Use for Research
## 11/25/2024

If you currently have a local Python environment on your computer, please do the following before lecture:
* Clone this repository on your local device
* Run the following command while your Python environment is active (i.e., in Terminal or in your preferred IDE):
```python 
%pip install censusdata geopandas matplotlib folium mapclassify googlesearch-python selenium nominatim-api geopy
```

If you're not sure what these mean, do not worry (and please do not email me). I will show my screen and you can follow along during lecture either way.
